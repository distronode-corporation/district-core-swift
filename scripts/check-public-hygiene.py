    python3 scripts/check-public-hygiene.py              # scan the tree
    python3 scripts/check-public-hygiene.py --self-test  # prove each rule works

The scan reads every tracked file plus every untracked file git does not ignore,
so a new file is checked before anyone commits it. Binary files (any NUL byte) are
skipped. Three rules:

    dash    An em dash (U+2014) or an en dash (U+2013), anywhere outside
            contracts/. Use commas, periods or parentheses. A string literal that
            has to hold the character at run time spells it as an escape
            (`"\\u{2014}"` in Swift), which keeps the value and passes the scan.
    host    An internal host name: anything under .internal, .local, .lan,
            .corp or .svc.cluster.local, and the origin-* hosts behind the public
            website (origin-<region> under distronode.com or distronode.ca). Names under
            example.com, example.org, example.net, .test, .example and .invalid
            are reserved for examples (RFC 2606) and are what test data uses.
    gitlab  A GitLab URL or host name. This repository lives on GitHub only.

Files under contracts/ are exempt from `dash` only: they are byte-for-byte copies
of the District AI service's recorded responses, edited nowhere but at the source,
and their sample message bodies contain dashes. They are still scanned for hosts
and GitLab URLs.

Adapted from the same check in distronode-corporation/district-linux. Its phone
and email rules are not carried over: this package's tests feed deliberately
malformed and non-reserved numbers to the dialler and the parsers, and every
address in test data is already at a reserved domain.

`--self-test` plants a violation of each rule, and look-alikes that must NOT trip
one, and fails unless every rule answers as expected. It also builds a throwaway
git repository to prove which files the scan reads. CI runs it before the scan, so
a rule that has stopped matching anything fails loudly instead of passing quietly.

This file spells the two dash characters as escapes and assembles its planted
violations at run time, so that it passes its own scan.
